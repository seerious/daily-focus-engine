~~~~~ Dev Log #1 – Why I Built the Daily Focus Engine ~~~~~

Most productivity apps are overkill. I wanted something dead simple: a tool to help me plan my day, stay focused, and reflect without getting lost in a GUI.

So I’m building the Daily Focus Engine — a CLI assistant that:

- Gives me a daily briefing

- Reminds me of focus blocks

- Prompts me to review at the end of the day

- Runs completely local

Next up: improve input prompts, add JSON-based persistence, and clean up the structure.
