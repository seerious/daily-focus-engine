# 🧠 Daily Focus Engine

A lightweight command-line assistant to help enforce your daily schedule, keep you focused, and reduce decision fatigue. Built for students, creators, and anyone trying to win the day without getting lost in space.

- 🧠 Daily reflection prompts ("What worked? What didn’t?")
- 📅 Tomorrow planning tool (lightweight review + plan)
- 📁 Local file storage — no cloud, no noise

## 💡 Why This Exists

Most "productivity" tools are bloated or distracting. This assistant is minimal by design — no GUI, no cloud sync, no feature creep. Just structured daily action.
